MySQL Learning Journey ðŸš€

I am currently taking a Udemy course on [MySQL](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-mysql-bootcamp-go-from-sql-beginner-to-expert/). This is where I document my learning progress through detailed notes and engaging practice activities. I hope to explore the fundamentals, master advanced techniques, and build a solid foundation in database management.
